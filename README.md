# Star Trek Quote Matching Game

Star Trek Quote Matching Game is for all the Trekkies out there! Players are presented with a quote and three characters to choose from, for each quote the player is given 3 chances to guess which character said that quote. My motivation for developing Star Trek Quote Matching Game was that I love Star Trek and wanted a new party game for all my nerdy friends and I.
